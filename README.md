# Medication Recommendation System for Polypharmacy Patients

A graph neural network (GNN) approach to recommend medications for patients with multiple conditions, incorporating adverse event prediction.

## Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of medication recommendation for polypharmacy patients (those taking multiple medications). Unlike traditional approaches that focus on single diseases, this system uses graph neural networks to model the complex relationships between patients, medications, and diagnoses.

## Features
- Heterogeneous graph construction using MIMIC-III data
- GNN-based medication recommendation
- Adverse event prediction for medication combinations
- Visualization of patient medication networks
- Diagnosis importance analysis

## Data
This project uses the MIMIC-III clinical database
